\chapter{Convention on Cybercrime}

\section{E-commerce on Dark Web}
The Dark Web provides a platform for buyers and sellers to engage in e-commerce transactions, often involving illicit goods and services. This anonymous marketplace operates with the same principles as traditional e-commerce, but with heightened security and privacy measures to conceal identities. \\ Vendors on the Dark Web offer a wide range of products, from drugs and weapons to stolen data and hacking services. Buyers can browse listings, read reviews, and complete purchases using cryptocurrencies, all while maintaining a high degree of anonymity.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{New Global Cybercrime Treaty (UN, August 8, 2024)}

\textbf{Content}:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Criminalization of unauthorized access to information systems
  \item Crimes related to online child exploitation and non- consensual explicit content distribution
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Criticism}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Concerns over human rights and press freedom
  \item Issues with data privacy and overly broad definitions of cybercrime
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aim of the Convention}
The convention aims to assist in combating crimes that are inherently linked to the use of technology, where devices serve as both the tool for committing the crime and the target of the crime
\begin{boxH}
  \textbf{Note:} there are differences when a crime is commited through a technology tool, and when the technology is the target of the crime.
\end{boxH}
as well as crimes where technology is used to enhance other criminal activities, such as fraud. It provides guidelines for countries to develop domestic cybercrime laws and acts as a foundation for international cooperation between parties.\\The \textbf{first additional protocol} focuses on criminalizing the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through computer systems, along with threats and insults motivated by racism and xenophobia.\\ The \textbf{second additional protocol} establishes common international rules to enhance cooperation on cybercrime, particularly in the collection of electronic evidence for criminal investigations and proceedings.

\subsection{Key points}

cybercrime and other offences being held by service providers in
foreign jurisdictions, but with law enforcement powers limited to
national boundaries.\\
Its main features are:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item A new legal basis permitting a direct request to registrars in other jurisdictions to obtain domain name registration information
  \item A new legal base permitting direct orders to service providers in other jurisdictions to obtain subscriber information
